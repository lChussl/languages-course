# IC-4700 | Project 2 - OOP coding with Java
In this project, you are required to design and implement a system using the Object-Oriented (OO) paradigm and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

The project involves the development of a web application that uses OO and databases as a mechanism for data persistence. The application to be developed should allow for the handling of images associated with species.
