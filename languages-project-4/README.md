The idea of this project is to create Lau-kata-kati game using the programming language C.

Lau-kata-kati is a game similar to Chinese Checkers but simplified, where two opponents
face off on a butterfly-shaped game board with the aim of capturing opposing pieces or
blocking them so they cannot move. More information and a video on how to play is
available at https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/lau-kata-kati/
